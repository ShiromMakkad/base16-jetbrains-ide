# base16-jetbrains-ide

This repository contains [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) themes for Jetbrains IDEs. Unlike [base16-jetbrains](https://github.com/adilosa/base16-jetbrains), this repository contains themes for the entire IDE. It also has an updated editor scheme which I'm pulling into [base16-jetbrains](https://github.com/adilosa/base16-jetbrains).

## Usage

Unfortunately, it's not possible to upload the IDE theme text file and have IntelliJ apply it. You'll need to create an IntelliJ project and compile the `.jar` file to upload to the IDE. You can follow [Creating Custom UI Themes](https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/reference_guide/ui_themes/themes.html) and [Deploying a Plugin](https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/deploying_plugin.html) for instructions. An example is available at [base16-jetbrains-ide-monokai](https://github.com/ShiromMakkad/base16-jetbrains-ide-monokai) (also available as a [plugin from the marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14399-base16-monokai)). 

### Todo
- Compile all the JAR files
