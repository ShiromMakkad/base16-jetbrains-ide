# base16-jetbrains-ide

This repository contains [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) themes for Jetbrains IDEs. Unlike [base16-jetbrains](https://github.com/adilosa/base16-jetbrains), this repository contains themes for the entire IDE. 

## Installation

1. Download the `.jar` file for your theme from `themes/`
2. In IntelliJ (or another Jetbrains IDE), Go to `File > Settings > Plugins`
3. At the top, there should be a `marketplace` tab, an `installed` tab, and three dots, click on the three dots
4. Click `Install Plugin from Disk...`
5. Navigate to the `.jar` file and install it
6. Restart your IDE
7. Select your new theme from `File > Settings > Appearance & Behavior > Appearance > Theme`!

## Compiling

The text files in `editor-themes/` and `ide-themes/` actually specify what the themes are, but unfortunately, IntelliJ won't allow us to upload the IDE themes directly, so we need to compile them into `.jar` files. Surprisingly, IntelliJ's theme `.jar` files are actually just renamed `.zip` files, so we don't even need Java to compile the themes! All you need is the `zip` command. Simply run `build.sh` and it will compile every theme properly. You may want to update the themes though in case any new ones got added or updated since I last compiled them. For that, you'll need to use a [Base16 Builder](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16#builder-repositories).


You could also create an IntelliJ project with it and compile it straight from IntelliJ. For that, follow [Creating Custom UI Themes](https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/reference_guide/ui_themes/themes.html) and [Deploying a Plugin](https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/deploying_plugin.html). An example is available at [base16-jetbrains-ide-monokai](https://github.com/ShiromMakkad/base16-jetbrains-ide-monokai) (also available as a [plugin from the marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14399-base16-monokai)).
